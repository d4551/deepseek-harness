## Summary

The experimental group contains prototype capabilities that are not part of any official release: they run on the real harness, but their contracts can change and they carry no support promise. The group holds the cross-realm Inspector and the browser-worker runtime and image packer used by preview deployments. Use these packages to try an unreleased capability; they carry no stability promise, and released products must not depend on them.
